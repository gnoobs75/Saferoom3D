## Visual Quality Checkpoints

### Good Implementation Signs:
✅ Silhouette is recognizable from 3+ meters
✅ Materials respond correctly to light (metal shines, stone doesn't)
✅ Glowing props emit visible light in dark areas
✅ Transparent props (water, glass) show some see-through
✅ Random variations make each instance unique
✅ Props fit the dungeon aesthetic (dark, gritty)

### Bad Implementation Signs:
❌ Props look like random geometric shapes
❌ All props same color/material
❌ Glowing props don't actually glow
❌ Water/blood looks solid (not liquid)
❌ Every instance identical (no variation)
❌ Props too bright/colorful for dungeon

---

## Lighting Tests

### In Torch Light:
- **Metals** (chains, sword, coins, spike trap): Should show specular highlights
- **Liquids** (water, blood, potion): Should reflect light
- **Organics** (bone, moss, bread): Should be matte (no shine)
- **Stone** (altar, tiles, rubble): Should be rough (minimal reflection)

### In Darkness (No Torches):
- **glowing_mushrooms**: Blue-green glow visible
- **engraved_rune**: Red-orange glow visible
- **shattered_potion**: Green glow visible
- **Other props**: Should be very dark/barely visible

### From Above (Bird's Eye View):
- **bone_pile**: Skull clearly visible as white circle
- **water_puddle**: Mirror-like reflection
- **blood_pool**: Dark red splatter
- **scattered_coins**: Gold dots
- **moss_patch**: Green irregular blob

## Common Visual Errors to Avoid

### 1. Z-Fighting:
**Problem**: Overlapping faces flicker
**Solution**: Ensure puddles/decals at Y=0.01 or higher

### 2. Inverted Normals:
**Problem**: Props appear black/unlit
**Solution**: Always call `surfaceTool.GenerateNormals()`

### 3. Too Bright in Dark:
**Problem**: Props visible in pitch black
**Solution**: Only use emission for magical props

### 4. No Variation:
**Problem**: All instances identical
**Solution**: Use RandomNumberGenerator for sizes, positions

### 5. Wrong Material Type:
**Problem**: Water looks solid, metal looks plastic
**Solution**: Check roughness/metallic values

---

## Performance Visual Indicators

### Good Performance:
- Smooth 60fps with 50+ props visible
- No hitching when props generate
- Distant props render correctly

### Performance Issues:
- FPS drops with many props
- Pop-in as props load
- Long generation times

**If performance issues occur:**
1. Reduce segments in AddCylinderToSurfaceTool (6 instead of 8)
2. Reduce segments in AddSphereToSurfaceTool (4 rings instead of 6)
3. Disable emission on distant props
4. Implement LOD system

## Final Checklist

Before considering enhancement complete:

- [ ] All 25 props implemented
- [ ] Each prop visually distinct
- [ ] Materials respond to light correctly
- [ ] Glowing props emit light
- [ ] Random variations present
- [ ] Performance acceptable (60fps)
- [ ] No visual artifacts
- [ ] Props fit dungeon theme
- [ ] Collision shapes match geometry
- [ ] All props tested in-game

**Expected result**: Dungeon feels much more immersive with detailed, recognizable props that tell environmental stories.
